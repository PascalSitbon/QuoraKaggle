# Scripts

  ## Siamesenetworks.py
      Run Siamese Neural Networks (just the training is coded for now, i will add the prediction soon)
      Scripts from siamesesfeatures.py are imported in siamesenetworks.py. To test it run : python Siamesenetworks.py
  
  ## Tfidfkronecker.py
      Run the algorithm from begin to end doing : TF IDF - Kronecker Product per duo of rows - Learning predictions.
      Run : python Tfidfkronecker.py and it will save the submission file from this simulation
  
  ## Basicfeatures.py
      NLP Features engineering and Grid search with random forest to learn. And then predict. If you launch it you will also         get the submission file.
